The purpose of the exercise was to design and implement a genetic algorithm that determines the parameters of the dynamic member based on the process of minimizing the assumed quality index and on analyzing the impact of control parameters such as:
stopping criterion ( number of iterations )
population size 
search space 
probability of mutation and crossover
